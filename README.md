## Development Workflow
Recommended practices; adapt as needed.

Branching
- main: stable, release-ready
- develop: integration
- feature/xyz: new features
- fix/xyz: bug fixes
- release/x.y.z: release prep

Commits
- Conventional Commits (feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test, build)
- Example: feat(input): add controller deadzone setting

Pull Requests
- Link issues, include before/after, screenshots
- Add tests where possible
- Keep changes focused and small
- PR checklist (copy into PR description):
  - [ ] Lints pass
  - [ ] Tests added/updated
  - [ ] No console errors
  - [ ] Updated docs/CHANGELOG if user-facing

Code Style
- Follow formatter/linter rules
- Avoid large monolithic classes; use composition
- Prefer data-driven configs over hard-coded constants

---

## Testing
Encourage at least smoke tests and core logic tests.

- Unit tests: tests/unit
- Integration tests: tests/integration
- End-to-end (web): Playwright/Cypress
- Snapshot/golden images for rendering (optional)
- Run tests:
  - Node: npm test
  - Python: pytest -q
  - Unity: use Test Runner or CLI (see below)

Unity CLI tests (example)
- Unity -batchmode -projectPath . -runTests -testResults results.xml -testPlatform EditMode -quit

Coverage
- Node: vitest --coverage or jest --coverage
- Python: pytest --cov=your_package
- Unity: use Code Coverage package (if licensed/available)

---

## Linting and Formatting
- JavaScript/TypeScript:
  - npm run lint
  - npm run format
- Python:
  - ruff check .
  - black .
- C# (Unity):
  - dotnet format
- Git hooks (optional):
  - Pre-commit hooks for lint/format on commit

---

## Building and Packaging
- Web:
  - npm run build -> dist/
  - Deploy dist/ to static hosting
- Desktop (Web game wrap):
  - Tauri/Electron build scripts
- Unity:
  - File -> Build Settings -> Build
  - CLI build script in scripts/build_unity.csx (example)
- Godot:
  - Export presets, then export
- Distribute on:
  - itch.io (butler push Builds/PLATFORM CHANNEL:tag)
  - Steam (steamcmd + depot tools)
  - GitHub Releases (attach zips)

---

## Deployment
Web
- Static hosting: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages
- Docker:
  - Dockerfile serves dist/ via nginx or node
  - docker compose -f compose.prod.yml up -d

Backend (if any)
- Deploy API separately (Railway/Fly.io/Render/Heroku/K8s)
- Configure CORS and API_BASE_URL accordingly

---

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and fixes.

- Black screen on launch
  - Update GPU drivers
  - Run with --disable-gpu (Electron)
- No audio
  - Check system output device and in-game audio settings
- Input not detected
  - Unplug/replug controller; check deadzone settings
- Ports in use (web)
  - Change dev server port: e.g., npm run dev -- --port 5174
- Python venv issues
  - Deactivate and recreate: rm -rf .venv && python -m venv .venv
